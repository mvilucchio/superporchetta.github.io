Hi! My name is Matteo Vilucchio, born in Bologna, IT in 1998.

I am currently studying at the [University of Pisa](https://www.df.unipi.it), master Physics. I will soon be a student at the [Ecole Normale Superieure](https://www.phys.ens.fr/?lang=en) in Paris, FR.

My main interests are physics and computer science, but I don't really know what I will be talking about.

#### Contribution

To make a man like me happy is a simple thing. If you find errors of any kind in any part of the blog you can open an **Issue** on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/superporchetta/superporchetta.github.io).

### Music

I listen to a lot of music. If you want to get to know me start by looking at the albums below. They are just some albums that I've listened to many times not an explicit list of my favourite albums (can someone even do that!?).
