### Introduction

Let's say it clearly: Bose-Einstein Condensates (or BECs in the field) are just a bunch of bosons held together under conditions that make them interesting. The typical working conditions are obtained by cooling the gas to a temperature very close to absolute zero: this assures that all the bosons remain in the the same energy state, the lower energy one. But why someone should do something like this? BECs are really interesting since they provide an example of quantum effects present at macroscopic scales. Since all bosons occupy the same quantum state their behaviour is collective rather than single.

The study of BECs is, right now, one of the most popular field of study for branches of physics like Condensed Matter, Numerical Physics and Statistical Physics. In addition to that the [2001 Physics Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2001/summary/) was awarded to three scientists _"for the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates."_

### Simulating the Evolution of a BEC System

Our work puts itself in the kind of works that try to understand the behaviour of BECs by simulating the evolution of the governing equations, both qualitatively and quantitatively, interpreting the results of the simulations.

The main goal of the computations was to simulate the appearance of vortices in the wave-function of the BEC.

### The Scripts

The scripts are contained in a GitHub repository. In the same repository there are also all the free references, a written report and a presentation, both of which were used during the defence of the project. The code used is documented at the best of our capabilities and if one, for some mysterious case would like to improve it, should feel free to do so.
